        <p>
          <h4>MerQ Mission:</h4> MerQ Squad is a social Gaming Community that is built
          solely for our players enjoyment. We strive for communication with
          our players when planning out our gaming servers such as; mods,
          server settings, maps, voting/donator rewards, and much much more!
          We love rewarding everyone that supports us from
          Subscriber/Donator/Voter Rewards, community give-aways and random
          freebies/perks to all of our community!
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Membership:</h4> MerQ is currently divided into 3 main groups –
          Owner/Admins, Subscribers/Donators, and Voters/Community.
          Owner/Admins runs the show. They are here to answer questions, help
          you in-game, and listen to your feedback while keeping an eye on the
          health of our servers. Subscribers/Donators are players that are
          able to show their support with either a monthly subscription or
          one-time donation. All support in this manner goes towards paying
          and upgrading the servers. Voters/Community are our backbone.
          Everyone who enjoy the our servers are a part of the MerQ community.
          Voting for our servers help promote us, where the whole community is
          able to support eachother with general how-to’s, FAQ’s and building
          a team!
